# SkyBridge Demo Backup Plan

## If backend is slow or broken:
- Explain using seed JSON files in /data
- Open token_examples.md to walk through calculations manually

## If frontend does not load:
- Verbally explain the flow:
  Cargo → Tokens → Airline bids → Selection

## If asked to prove correctness:
- Show priorities.json and distances.json
- Walk through one token example step-by-step

## If time is cut short:
- Say:
  "The core innovation is the tokenized cargo valuation —
   everything else builds on that foundation."
